Universe-PalmOS
===============

Old Universe browser for PalmOS. The source code is version 3.0.

I evolved the WAPUniverse browser for PalmOS, originally written by Filip Onkelinx, and this is the code. It really isn't super pretty. UniverseCore was a browser engine that I was writing to replace Universe's old, hacked engine. It is also a better example of my evolved coding ability. Someday I may return to the project and finish Atlas (another project that will land here) that was to support multiple browser engines, and become Universe v4.0. At this point, webOS was taking off and it made more sense to focus efforts there. The Universe-Mojo project is the result of this.
