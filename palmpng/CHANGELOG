    - when DecodePngToBitmap is called, alpha doesn't have to be aligned for arm (to 4bytes)
    - new function WinPaintAlphaImage
12.07.2006:
    - by Donald C. Kirker: in WinPaintAlphaImage coordinates are multiplied by 2 only if drawwindow uses screen coordinate system
    - WinPaintAlphaImage worked incorrectly with bitmap data - on palm bitmaps use different endian then windows, so its different to work with created bitmap and with bitmap taken from window
13.07.2006:
    - WinPaintAlphaImage doesn't draw to points not in active clip rectangle
    - if png file has background set it ignored (support is not compiled in png library)
18.08.2006:
    - functions check if library handler is not null before they proceed

    - from arm code peal creates resource where it emits only used symbols..

    - changed png decoding, before it allocated 2xspace for decompressedimage, now only 1x
    - new function WinPaintAlphaImageBs, works like ordinary one but with byteswapped window content (BitmapWindow)
