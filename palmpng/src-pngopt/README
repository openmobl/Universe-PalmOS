usage: ./pngopt file1.png file2.png....

purpose: 

on palm we work with 16bpp images and 5 bits for transparency. real png may contain too much
information (8 or even 16bits for color channel and or transparency)

this pngoptimizer will remove all unnecesary streams from pngfile, set all unused bits to 0
and recompress png with maximum available filtering and maximum compression. result is usually 
smaller then original, in theory it should save about 30% from size (compared to 32bpp source)
but reality may vary.

warning. optimizer will overwrite source image and will not create backup. so backup originals 
if you will need them later!
