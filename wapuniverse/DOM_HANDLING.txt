How to handle special elements in the DOM:

*Text field backgrounds: Draw and background colors, otherwise just draw the text
*Horizontal rules: draw to a bitmap and store as a bitmap.
*Any resource images (and objects in list): store as a bitmap with no location or alt


Roadmap:
*draw everything ontop of the old window (i.e. window is drawn to screen and then the DOM is drawn)
*delete all references to g->DrawWin


For RSS:
parse everything into the DOM like usual. When dealing with the top header create an area at (0,0)
with height of the saded bitmap. Put the shaded bitmap at (0,0). When done with the top, go through
and resize the area and then reposition the shaded bitmap.
