# WAPUniverse development note:
# 
# This is not all of the contents of the original iScript source. Just the
# source that builds the iScript libraries. I cut it back to make the ZIP
# file smaller. If you want the tools and examples please download them
# from http://www.taptarget.com/. I also have them upon request.
# 
# Bugs for version (1.2.1) included with WAPUniverse:
# -------------------------------------------------------
# -Float support isn't fully complete
# -Float support is buggy. Doesn't always return correct values.
#  This seems to happen the most with multiplication and division.
